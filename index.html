                About Me: Hello, my name is Cole Cerull and I am currently a student The University of Colorado at Boulder. I am perusing a bachelors in computer science with a minor in geography and I plan to graduate in December 2023.
                I have always been interested in the way that things work and loved to learn about new things. The thing that jumpstarted my interest for computers was while rebuilding my old Volkswagen, I spent a lot of time 
                with the engine control unit that is basically the brain of an engine. I was so intrigued with how it worked and continued to learn more. For a few years I worked for a company where we would reprogram these engine
                control units with high performance calibrations to squeeze extra power and efficiency out of them. As we stray from traditional internal combustion powered vehicles into electric, I'm excited to see where things 
                will go for the automotive aftermarket.
