        <!-- <p>Here I talk about why accesability is important. I will go over how good accesable websites are also better websites in general, discuss the types of accesable features and who might use those.</p>
        <p>Cover the different standards as well to show why some orginizations are required to meet certain standards.</p> -->

        <p>Social media, shoping, news, you name it and it's probably in a digital format now, therfore it is important that every person, no matter their abilities or disabilities is able to easily access that digital content
          easily. By adhering to universal design principles, websites become more user-friendly for individuals with diverse needs, making a seamless and positive user experience. Accesability features in these designs cater 
          to those with disabilities so that they may experience the content as seamlessly and with minimal issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prioritizing accesability and universal design not only is ethicaly right but it is also legaly required for certain types of websites such as government funded ones and also in other countries.
        </p>

        <P>
          Creating websites that acessable not only bennefits those that are disabled but also improves the website overall for every user.
