      <h2>How?</h2>
        <p>
          Implementing Universal Design in your next project can be easier than you think. Once you learn how universal design and accesability features are implemented, it will be much easier to prioritize
          through the entire design and development process. Consider diverse user needs, including those with varying abilities, and adhere to web accessibility standards such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
          There are lots of resources on the web that give easy to understand examples and guides on how to implement each of these. Some of the main features are; having tezt that is legible with sufficient color contrast, Provide 
          alternative image tags to accomadate screen readers, and creating a consistent and logical navigation structure. Designing forms that have clear instuctions and error messages, and make the interactive elements of the Site
          accessable by keyboard navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          While creating your website or even when it is complete, there are lots of great tools that can verify there are no errors. Once errors are identified it is easy to go back and fix them, some tools even tell you how to fix it!
          To list a few tools, the WAVE plugin for google chrome shows errors, in things such as contrast, missing alt tags and more. W3 Validator takes in your code or web address and locates errors or potential problems and checks if the site is up to formatting standards.
          One additional tool is the html5 outliner that shows the outline of your site so you can make sure it is structured well and makes sense so it will be understandable from a screen reader.
