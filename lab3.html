            <span aria-hidden="true" class="material-symbols-outlined">summarize</span>
            <p> <strong>John Patrick Daly</strong> (born April 28, 1966) is an <em>American professional golfer</em> on the <abbr title="Professional Golfers' Association of America">PGA</abbr> Tour and PGA Tour Champions. Daly is known primarily for his driving distance off the tee (earning him the nickname "Long John"), <mark>his non-country-club appearance and attitude</mark>, his exceptionally long backswing, the inconsistency of his play (with some exceptional performances and some controversial incidents), and his personal life. His two greatest on-course accomplishments are his "zero-to-hero" victory in the 1991 PGA Championship, and his playoff victory over Costantino Rocca in the 1995 Open Championship.</p>

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <span aria-hidden="true" class="material-symbols-outlined">child_care</span>
            <p>Daly was born in Carmichael, California, on April 28, 1966. His father is Jim Daly, a construction worker for industrial plants; his mother is Lou Daly, a homemaker. The Daly family, solidly middle-class, moved very frequently during Daly's formative years, living in small towns across the Southern states. His father frequently worked night shifts, and often had to commute significant distances between work and home.</p>

            <h2>College</h2>
            <span aria-hidden="true" class="material-symbols-outlined">school</span>
            <p>Daly attended the University of Arkansas, from 1984 to 1987, on a golf scholarship, and was a member of the golf team. His golf team coaches were Steve Loy and Bill Woodley. Daly had tempestuous relationships with both due to his drinking problems and infrequent class attendance. Daly qualified for the 1986 U.S. Open, one of the four majors of male professional golf, as an amateur, and missed the 36-hole cut with scores of 88 and 76.</p>

            <span aria-hidden="true" class="material-symbols-outlined">sports_golf</span>
            <p>Daly has a flowing self-taught golf swing which was built for raw power and distance. Daly takes his golf club back much farther past parallel on his back swing by extreme coiling of his arms and shoulders which creates very fast club head speed on his down swing. However, Daly's golf swing has contributed to his inconsistent performance during golf tournaments since almost perfect timing is required for proper execution of such a powerful golf swing.</p>

                <P>In 2007, Daly provided back-up vocals in the Kid Rock song, "Half Your Age".[58] In April 2010, Daly released his second music album called I Only Know One Way on Long Ball Records/Hopesong Digital/GMV Nashville. He wrote and co-wrote eight tracks on the album. One track includes Hootie And The Blowfish's lead singer Darius Rucker and a cover of Bob Dylan's "Knockin' On Heaven's Door". John said about his perspective on his music: "The album itself is really my life. All of the songs have a meaning. Most of the record is happening or has happened in my life. I hope people can relate to some of the troubles I have had along the way. Everyone around the world has problems, and I want to connect with those people." Daly's first album, My Life, included guest vocals by Darius, Willie Nelson and Johnny Lee.</P>
